# freecodecamp-projects

As part of the Responsive Web Design Certification at FreeCodeCamp.org, these are my 5 first HTML-CSS projects.

[**1. A tribute page on Charles Bukowski**](https://ibaifernandez.github.io/freecodecamp-projects/tribute-page/ "Google's Homepage")

With this design, I had my first contact with HTML and CSS working with CSS Box and learning to `float` elements.

**2. A survey form**

With this design, I learned about HTML forms and CSS Flex, as well as animating backgrounds and styling HTML form's elements.

**3. A landing page**

With this design, I deepened in CSS Flex Box and relative units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax) as well as CSS animations.

**4. A documentation page**

With this design, I deepened in CSS positioning.
    
**5. A portfolio site**

With this design, I brought together all I've learnt so far.
