                <h2>Main facts about Charles Bukowski</h2>
                <div class="main-text">
                    <p><strong>Henry Charles Bukowski</strong>, born Heinrich Karl Bukowski on August 16, 1920 was a German–American writer who authorized poetry, novels and short stories. Influenced by the social, cultural, and economic ambiance of his adoptive city, <strong>Los Angeles</strong>, his work addresses a number of topics suchs as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ordinary lives of poor Americans.</li>
                        <li>The act of writing.</li>
                        <li>Alcohol (and alcoholism).</li>
                        <li>Relationships with women.</li>
                        <li>The drudgery of work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Bukowski</strong> wrote thousands of poems, hundreds of short stories and six novels, eventually publishing over 60 books. The FBI kept a file on him as a result of his column <strong><em><a href="#">Notes of a Dirty Old Man</a></em></strong> in the LA underground newspaper <strong>Open City</strong>. He published extensively in small literary magazines and with small presses beginning in the early 1940s and continuing on through the early 1990s. As noted by one reviewer:</p>

                        <div class="quote-marks"></div>
                        <blockquote cite="https://www.palgrave.com/gp/?K=9781137343543">"<strong>Bukowski</strong> continued to be, thanks to his antics and deliberate clownish performances, the king of the underground and the epitome of the littles in the ensuing decades, stressing his loyalty to those small press editors who had first championed his work and consolidating his presence in new ventures such as the New York Quarterly, Chiron Review, or Slipstream."</blockquote>

                    </div>
                    <p>Since his death in 1994, Bukowski has been the subject of a number of critical articles and books about both his life and writings, despite his work having received relatively little attention from academic critics in the United States during his lifetime. In contrast, Bukowski enjoyed extraordinary fame in Europe, especially in Germany, the place of his birth.</p>

                    <p>Through his impressive output of poems, short stories and novels, Henry Charles Bukowski offers an intimate portrait of a lower class America struggling with vices in the face of a crushed American dream. Vincent Wood explores how Bukowski’s own association with the down and out experience inspired these important works of modern American literature.</p>
